# Audio, Image, and CSV Processing Project

This project focuses on working with various types of data including audio, images, and CSV files using Python libraries. It demonstrates how to record and manipulate voice signals, process images, and work with tabular data stored in CSV files.

## Project Overview

The main tasks include:
- **Audio Processing**: Recording a 30-second voice signal using Python and applying various signal transformations.
- **Image Processing**: Loading, transforming, and analyzing images using `scikit-image`.
- **CSV Processing**: Loading and manipulating CSV data using `pandas`.

## Setup

To set up this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
   

2. Ensure the following Python packages are installed:
   - `numpy`
   - `pandas`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `sounddevice`
   - `soundfile`
   - `scikit-image`

   You can install them manually using:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib sounddevice soundfile scikit-image
   ```

## Running the Project

1. Open the Jupyter notebook (`MF_Mini_Project.ipynb`) using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook MF_Mini_Project.ipynb
   ```

2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to:
   - **Audio Processing**: Record your voice signal for 30 seconds, play it back, and apply transformations.
   - **Image Processing**: Load an image, apply transformations, and visualize it.
   - **CSV Processing**: Load CSV data into a `pandas` DataFrame and perform data manipulation or analysis.

## Key Features

### Audio Processing
- Record, play, and manipulate audio signals using `sounddevice` and `soundfile`.
- Apply transformations like noise reduction and filtering.

### Image Processing
- Load and process images using the `scikit-image` library.
- Perform tasks like resizing, filtering, and edge detection.

### CSV Processing
- Load and manipulate CSV files using the `pandas` library.
- Perform data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.

## Key Libraries Used

- **numpy**: For numerical operations on data.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis of CSV files.
- **matplotlib**: For visualizing data (audio, images, and CSV).
- **sounddevice**: For recording and playing audio signals.
- **soundfile**: For reading and writing sound files.
- **scikit-image**: For loading and processing images.
